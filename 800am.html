  Morph Man is a super hero that people have only been able to see when he is in the process of morphing into something else. No one is sure what he actually looks like, if he is human or, some sort of creature. He doesn't do anything to harm. Morph Man only protects and watches over civilians to make sure their day to day lives are going smoothly. He is a strong and powerful being that can stop just about everything that he is confronted with. He constantnly morphs into different things to blend in with his surroundings making it hard for anyone to see him. 
  Considering Morph Man is hard to track, we don't have much background information on him. We have discovered that he is from Baltimore and we believe that he is in his late twenties.
