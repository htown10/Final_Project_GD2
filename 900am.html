  Morph Man is a creature like no other. He can change rapidly into any surrounding so that he can blend in and solve whatever issue he faces. His power is amazing and only few people have caught him morphing. When he desides to change it happens in a blink of an eye but, his initial morph takes longer than all the following changes which is when people are able to catch him morphing. No one knows what he looks like outside of seeing this being morph. He has only been seen changing his physical appearance which creates this abstact figure of colors. After he morphs he almost becomes invisible to the eye. It is very challenging to see him because he is constantly changing his appearance to match his surrounding.
